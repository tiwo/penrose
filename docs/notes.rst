Some notes and links
====================


Jeff Preshing has a `nice short page on the triangle subdivisions
<http://preshing.com/20110831/penrose-tiling-explained/>`_. (Note that his
(marked, apex, unmarked) vertices are named (B, A, C) whereas mine are named
(A, B, C).



For future reference, here's how to figured out the whole pentagrid thing: Laura
Effinger-Dean's `bachelor's thesis`__ "The Empire Problem in Penrose Tilings", 
chapter 4 Pentagrids, 4.2 Construction the dual.
